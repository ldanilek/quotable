# Quotable

A Convex app for sharing quotes.

This app exercises some features that I have not used before:

1. Clerk auth
2. HTTP endpoints, in the form of a Discord bot
3. Actions calling fetch on Discord APIs
4. Crons
5. Search
6. Python client

NOTE: point Discord at your dev instance by changing 
the "INTERACTIONS ENDPOINT URL" to "https://careless-mouse-736.convex.site/discord"
For prod it should be "https://academic-goose-714.convex.site/discord"
